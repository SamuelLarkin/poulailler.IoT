#### Create a Database

[How to set default retention policy and duration for InfluxDB via configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41640770)

```
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>
[WITH [DURATION <duration>] [REPLICATION <n>]
      [SHARD DURATION <duration>] [NAME <retention-policy-name>]]
```


#### Retention Policies

```
CREATE RETENTION POLICY <retention_policy_name> ON <database_name> DURATION <duration> REPLICATION <n> [SHARD DURATION <duration>] [DEFAULT]
```

```
# every 10s
# 24h * 60min/h * 6/min = 8640
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "jour" ON "poulailler" DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT
# every 2 mins
# 7d/w 24h/d * 12/h = 5040
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "semaine" ON "poulailler" DURATION 1w REPLICATION 1
# every 15 mins
# 365d/y * 24h/d * 4/h = 35040
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "annee" ON "poulailler" DURATION 52w REPLICATION 1
```


#### Continuous Queries

[Continuous Queries Advanced Syntax](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/continuous_queries/#advanced-syntax)

```
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY <cq_name> ON <database_name>
RESAMPLE EVERY <interval> FOR <interval>
BEGIN
  <cq_query>
END
```

```
cq_query
SELECT <function[s]> INTO <destination_measurement> FROM <measurement> [WHERE <stuff>] GROUP BY time(<interval>)[,<tag_key[s]>]
```

Automatically downsampling data into another retention policy

Fully qualify the destination measurement to store the downsampled data in a non-DEFAULT retention policy (RP).

Automatically downsampling a database with backreferencing

Use a function with a wildcard (*) and INTO queryâ€™s backreferencing syntax to automatically downsample data from all measurements and numerical fields in a database.

```
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY "cq_basic_br" ON "transportation"
BEGIN
  SELECT mean(*) INTO "downsampled_transportation"."autogen".:MEASUREMENT FROM /.*/ GROUP BY time(30m),*
END
```

#### Create the Database

```
#CREATE DATABASE poulailler
CREATE DATABASE poulailler
  WITH DURATION 1d
  REPLICATION 1
  NAME jour
```

```
#CREATE RETENTION POLICY jour ON "poulailler" DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT
CREATE RETENTION POLICY semaine ON "poulailler" DURATION 1w REPLICATION 1
CREATE RETENTION POLICY annee ON "poulailler" DURATION 52w REPLICATION 1
```

```
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY cq_2m ON poulailler BEGIN
  SELECT mean(temperature) AS temperature, mean(humidite) AS humidite
  INTO poulailler.semaine.metrics
  FROM metrics
  GROUP BY time(2m),*
END

CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY cq_15m ON poulailler BEGIN
  SELECT mean(temperature) AS temperature, mean(humidite) AS humidite
  INTO poulailler.annee.metrics
  FROM metrics
  GROUP BY time(15m),*
END
```
